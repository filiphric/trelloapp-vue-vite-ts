## v0.1.7 2015-01-19

Updated unicode filename handling â€“ only revert to parameter continuation if the value actually includes
non-ascii characters or is too long. Previously filenames were encoded if they included anything
besides letters, numbers, dot or space.

Fixed an issue with `encodeWords` where a trailing space was invalidly included in a word if the word
ended with an non-ascii character.

Do not use quotes for continuation encoded filename parts. Fixes an issue with Gmail where the Gmail webmail keeps the charset as part of the filename.
