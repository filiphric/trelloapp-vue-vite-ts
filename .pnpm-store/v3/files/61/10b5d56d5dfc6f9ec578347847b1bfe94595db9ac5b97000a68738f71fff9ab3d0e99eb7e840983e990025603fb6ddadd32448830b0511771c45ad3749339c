DRY, configure path aliases only once and in the right place. 

Never heard of path aliases? One of many articles on how it makes our life easier https://netbasal.com/sexier-imports-in-typescript-e3c645bdd3c6

## Use case

You are tired of duplicating code when you need to add a new path alias (`alias` section in webpack config and `paths` section in tsconfig.json). 

Now you can add it only to tsconfig.json and no longer worry about the rest 


## Getting Started

### A new project

If yon don't have a project, you can create TypeScript project using vue cli:

```sh
vue create my-vue-lib
```

Or use preset `vatson/vue-ts-lib` that includes ts-paths and ts-bundler plugins to speed up the development of any components library
_More information you can find here https://github.com/vatson/vue-ts-lib_

### Adding to a project

Install the plugin into your project:

```sh
cd my-vue-app
vue add ts-paths
```

That's it. You do not have to do anything else. Just add new aliases to `tsconfig.json`.
