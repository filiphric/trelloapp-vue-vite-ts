- Xfce4 desktop environment

## __Notes__

## __Bugs__

1. loading home page with the "Get started!" text means 110 requests and about 5.8 MB of data transferred; that's queite a lot of one page with not much on it

    - one JS file is over 1 MB in size, several other ones close to 1 MB

2. no dot after the second sentence on the signup page

login page does cointain the dot: "Donâ€™t have an account? Sign up here."

3. warnings in JS console

4. there are no FE or BE validations for string lengths; I probably mentioned this bug earlier as well

5. login screen picture is out of proportions and is not shown nicely on a mobile device

similarly for signup page:

and homepage in its other version:

6. login and signup page elements like input boxes are too narrow on mobile devices

7. it's hard to scroll on a board detail page on mobile devices; many times, lists are moved instead of moving the page

8. placeholder on homepage is not readable on mobile devices

9. uncaught exception when there is a network error:

    - I suspect this might happen at other places in the app as well
    - the FE app doesn't seem to notife the user in any way

10. there is no meaningful error message in case the server returns 500; I experienced this error on login and signup page

    - I suspect this might happen at other places in the app as well

11. missing API documentation

    - some form (e.g. automatically generated) of API documentation is usually helpful to devs, testers, and other people; it takes much longer to figure out what an API does with no documentation
